      One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself
      transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back,
      and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly
      domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able
      to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully
      thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he
      looked.u

      &quot;What's happened to me?&quot; he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper
      human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four
      familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table &mdash;
      Samsa was a travelling salesman &mdash; and above it there hung a picture that he
      had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded
      frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright,
      raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the
      viewer.
